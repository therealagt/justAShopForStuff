# Just A Shop - E-Commerce Store

This is a simple e-commerce store to show some skills and get further reps in. 
It's another project from The Odin Project. 
 
Material UI was used for components and i took some structural inspiration from the 
MUI docs. So it's a mixture of components and parts of templates. 

I used the SPA routing mechanics from React Router for client-side routing, makes the transition
between components smoother and more efficient. 

And finally some state management shenanigans via React.

What isn't there is a functional database backend and user management and verification
both on the user-side and server-side.
